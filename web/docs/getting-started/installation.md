# Installation

LeoJS is implemented as a Visual Studio Code (_VSCode_ or _VSCodium_) extension, and uses its UI and API internally to offer all of Leo's fundamental functionality. 

It is therefore easiest to install in your local or web VSCode instance by opening the **Extension View** to find the LeoJS extension in the marketplace, and clicking the **Install** button.

You can also download the .vsix extension file directly at the [Microsoft Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=boltex.leojs) or the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/boltex/leojs) install it manually with the `Extension: Install from VSIX` command in VSCode.
