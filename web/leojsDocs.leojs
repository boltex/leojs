If you intend to use Leo for programming, read the [scripting tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-scripting.md), then look at Leo's source code in the file Leojs.leo. Spend 5 or 10 minutes browsing through the outline. Don't worry about details; just look for the following common usage patterns:\n\n- Study @file leoNodes.ts. It shows how to define more than one class in single file.\n\n- Most other files show how to use a single @others directive to define one class.\n\n- Most methods are defined using @others, *not* section definition nodes.\n",

    "felix.20240829001804.12": "\nClones make reorganizing an outline significantly easier and faster.  Simply make top-level clones of the nodes you keep encountering during the reorg. This makes moving a node a snap: just move it from one clone to another.\n",
    "felix.20240829001804.13": "\n_From this forum discussion [forum discussion](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/4s44H9cUJGY/ewRBDBSw-A8J)_\n\nFor the last several weeks I've used clones in a new, more effective way, inspired by git's stash/unstash commands. Here are the main ideas.\n\n1. [Most important] I avoid putting clones in two different *external* files.\n\nFor any task, I create a task node that resides in @file leoToDo.txt. I clone that node and put it in the outline, *never* in any other @file node. This instantly eliminates clone wars.\n\n2. I use top-level \"stashed\" nodes/trees in my local copy of leoPy.leo.\n\nThese clones are *not* written to any external file, so they would be lost if I lost leoPy.leo. But the risks are negligible because all stashed nodes are clones of nodes that *do* exist in external files.\n\n3. I have two main stashed trees: recent files and recent code.\n\nThe \"recent files\" tree contains clones of all the @file nodes I have worked on recently. This speeds up access to them. That happens surprisingly often--often enough to be well worth maintaining the tree. Furthermore, because Leo's new pylint command now works on trees, I can check all recently-changed files simply by running pylint on the \"recent files\" tree.\n\nThe \"recent code\" tree is even more valuable, for three reasons. The first is obvious--it speeds access to recently-changed nodes.\n\nSecond, the \"recent code\" tree allows me to work on multiple tasks without getting overwhelmed by details and loose nodes lying around. I add organizer nodes as needed to make accessing the nodes faster, and also to jog my memory about what I was doing when I changed those nodes ;-)\n\nThird, the \"recent code\" tree allows me *not* to put clones in the @file leoProjects.txt tree. This leads me to...\n\n4. I use clones in a stylized way when fixing and committing bugs.\n\nI always use clones when working on a project. A \"task\" node contains clones of all nodes related to the task. The task node typically remains in leoToDo.txt until the task is completely finished. While working on the bug, I create a clone of the task node, and move that clone to the bottom top-level node of the outline. Among other things, this makes it easy to limit searches without actually choosing \"suboutline only\" in the Find panel. This workflow is decades old.\n\nThe following is the heart of the new workflow. When a task is complete, I do the following:\n\n- First, I create a **stashed-task** node, containing all the clones that were previously in the task node.\n    The *stashed-task* becomes pre-writing for the commit log. The *task* node instantly becomes pre-writing for the release notes, so if it needs to discuss any code in the clones that have just been moved to the stashed-task node, I write those words immediately, while all details are fresh in my mind.\n\n- Now I move the cloned task node that is in leoToDo.txt to the appropriate place in leoProjects.txt.\n\n- Next I do the commit.\n    The *other* clone of the task node, and the stashed task node are still within easy reach, and I typically use both nodes to create the commit log. The commit will typically consist of the changed leoToDo.txt and leoProjects.txt and whatever .py files the task itself changed. Happily, leoToDo.txt and leoProjects.txt are now up-to-date because of steps A and B.\n\n- Finally, I clean up.\n    I delete the top-level clone of the task node, and move the stashed-task node to the \"recent code\" tree.\n\nLater, when it appears that activity has died down on various projects, I'll delete nodes from the \"recent files\" an \"recent code\" trees. This is a minor judgment call: I want to leave nodes in the trees while they are useful, but not significantly longer than that. I do *not* regard these trees as permanently useful. leoProjects.txt should contain *all* permanent notes about a project.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nThis work flow may seem complicated. Believe me, it is not. It's easier to use than to describe.\n\nThis workflow has big advantages:\n\n1. Clone wars are gone for good.\n2. All recent data is easily available.\n3. Task nodes and stashed-task nodes provide natural places for proto-documentation.\n4. Banning clones from leoProjects.txt forces me to complete the first draft of the documentation before committing the fix.\n",
    "felix.20240829001804.14": "\nSome people seem to think that it is difficult to understand how Leo handles \"clone wars\": differing values for a cloned nodes that appear in several external files. That's not true. The rule is:\n\n<ul>\n    **The last clone that Leo reads wins.**\n</ul>\n\nThat is, for any cloned node C, Leo takes the value of C.h and C.b to be the values specified by the last copy that Leo reads.\n\nThere is only one complication:\n\n<ul>\n    **Leo reads the entire outline before reading any external files.**\n</ul>\n\nThus, if C appears in x.leo, y.py and z.py, Leo will choose the value for C in x.py or y.py, depending on which @\\<file> node appears later in the outline.\n\n> 📌 **NOTE**\\\n> Whenever Leo detects multiple values for C when opening an outline, Leo creates a \"Recovered nodes\" tree. This tree contains all the various values for C, nicely formatted so that it is easy to determine where the differences are.\n",
    "felix.20240829001804.15": "\nA **dangerous** delete is a deletion of a node so that all the data in the node is deleted *everywhere* in an outline. The data is gone, to be retrieved only via undo or via backups. It may not be obvious which deletes are dangerous in an outline containing clones. Happily, there is a very simple rule of thumb:\n\n- Deleting a non-cloned node is *always* dangerous.\n- Deleting a cloned node is *never* dangerous.\n\nWe could also consider a delete to be dangerous **if it results in a node being omitted from an external file.** This can happen as follows. Suppose we have the following outline (As usual, A' indicates that A is marked with a clone mark):\n\n```\n    - @file spam.py\n        - A'\n            - B\n    - Projects\n        - A'\n            - B\n```\n\nNow suppose we clone B, and move the clone so the tree looks like this:\n\n```\n    - @file spam.py\n        - A'\n            - B'\n    - Projects\n        - A'\n            - B'\n        - B'\n```\n\nIf (maybe much later), we eliminate B' as a child of A will get:\n\n```\n    - @file spam.py\n        - A'\n    - Projects\n        - A'\n        - B\n```\n\nB has not been destroyed, but B is gone from @file spam.py! So in this sense deleting a clone node can also be called dangerous.\n",
    "felix.20240829001804.16": "\nQ: When can I delete a clone safely?\n\nA: Any time! The only time you can \"lose\" data is when you delete a non-cloned node, save your work and exit Leo.\n\nQ: What gets \"lost\" when I delete a non-cloned node?\n\nA: The node, and all it's non-cloned children. In addition, if the node contains all clones of a cloned node, all copies of the cloned node will also be \"lost\".\n\nQ: Anything else I should be careful about concerning clones?\n\nNot really.  If you move any node out \"underneath\" an @file (@clean, etc) node, the contents of that node disappears from the external file.\n\nI hope this encourages more people to use clones.  Leo's clone-find commands are something that every Leo programmers should be using every day.\n",
    "felix.20240829001804.17": "\nAny outline (.leo file) may contain clones that appear in multiple external files defined *within* that outline. There is no problem with such **intra-outline clones**.\n\nIn contrast, **cross-outline clones** are clones that appear in more than one outline.  Leo's paste-retaining-clones command makes it possible for two outlines to contain nodes with the same gnx. Conceivably, both outlines could use those clones in the *same* external file!\n\nLeo will never encourage cross-outline clones, because such clones are inherently dangerous. Indeed, neither outline would have full responsibility for its own data. \n\nIndeed, the shared clones would be subject to the well-known multiple-update problem. Suppose the two outlines were open simultaneously, and each outline changed the shared clones in different ways. Whichever outline changed the data last would \"win.\" The changes in the other outline would be lost forever!\n\nIn short, Leo will never support features that encourage cross-outline clones.\n",

The headlines_ are indented with tabs which Excel will read as a tab delimited format. Once inside Excel there are benefits.\n\n1. The most obvious benefit inside Excel is that the body sections (Excel first column) can be selected easily and highlighted with a different font color. This makes the MORE format very readable. Save a copy of your sheet as HTML and now you have a web page with the body sections highlighted.\n\n2. It is possible to hide columns in Excel. Hiding the first column leaves just the headlines showing.\n\n3. Formulas based on searching for a string can do calculations in Excel. For example if a heading \"Current Assets\" appears on level 4 then the body formula:\n\n```\n=INDEX(A:A,MATCH(\"Current Assets\",D:D,0)+1)\n```\n\nwill retrieve it. The +1 after match looks down one row below the matched headline. The trick is to place all your headlines in quotes because Excel will see + \"Current Assets\" from the MORE outline. When Excel tries without the quotes it thinks it is a range name and displays a #N/A error instead of the headline. Also you must place a child node_ below to get the + sign instead of a - sign which would give a MORE headline of -\"Current assets\" , also is an error.\n\nI think there is some interesting possibility here because of the enforcement of Leo body text being always in the first column. The Leo outline provides additional reference to organizing the problem not typical of spreadsheet models. Beyond scripting in Python, Excel is good at doing interrelated calculations and detecting problems like circular references. In Excel Tools-Options-General is a setting for r1c1 format which then shows numbers instead of letters for column references. Using this would allow entries like this in the leo body:\n\n```\n1000\n3500\n=R[-1]C+R[-2]C\n```\n\nIn Excel you would see 4500 below those two numbers.

It happens when an @others directive or a section name appears indented in a higher-level node body.

I can get the XML as I want it by using @language html, but how can I get the tangling comments inside the CData section to be java-style comments rather than html ones?\n\nA: In @file trees you use the @delims directive to change comment delimiters.
