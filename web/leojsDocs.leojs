'open1' and 'open2' hooks: These are called with a keywords dict containing the following entries:\n\n    - c:          The commander of the newly opened window.\n    - old_c:      The commander of the previously open window.\n    - new_c:      (deprecated: use 'c' instead) The commander of the newly opened window.\n    - fileName:   The name of the file being opened.\n\n    You can use old_c.p and c.p to get the current position in the old and new windows.\n    Leo calls the 'open1' and 'open2' hooks only if the file is not already open. Leo\n    will also call the 'open1' and 'open2' hooks if: a) a file is opened using the\n    Recent Files menu and b) the file is not already open.\n\n3. g.app.closeLeoWindow calls the 'close-frame' hook just before\n    removing the window from g.app.windowList. The hook code may remove the window\n    from app.windowList to prevent g.app.closeLeoWindow from destroying the window.\n\n4. Leo calls the 'headkey1' and 'headkey2' when the headline has *actually* changed.\n\n5. p is the new node (position) containing '@auto filename.ext'\n\n6. The d argument to the open-with event handlers is a dictionary whose keys\n    are all the tags specified by the user in the body of the @openwith node.\n",

    "felix.20240829001804.5": "First, read `Leo's tutorials`_. This will be enough to get you started if you just want to use Leo as an outliner_. If you intend to use Leo for programming, read the `scripting tutorial`_, then look at Leo's source code in the file Leojs.leo. Spend 5 or 10 minutes browsing through the outline. Don't worry about details; just look for the following common usage patterns:\n\n- The (Projects) tree shows how to use clones to represent tasks.\n\n- Study @file leoNodes.ts. It shows how to define more than one class in single file.\n\n- Most other files show how to use a single @others directive to define one class.\n\n- Most methods are defined using @others, *not* section definition nodes.\n",
    "felix.20240829001804.6": "\nUse methods for any code that is used (called or referenced) more than once.\n\nSections_ are convenient in the following circumstances:\n\n- When you want to refer to snippets of code the can not be turned into methods.

This is surprisingly easy and safe to do, *provided* the section is used only in one place. `Section names`_ in such contexts can be clearer than method names.  For example:\n\n```\n    << init ivars for writing >>\n```\n\nIn short, I create sections when convenient, and convert them to functions or methods if they need to be used in several places.\n",
    "felix.20240829001804.10": "The c.cloneFindAllAtNode and c.cloneFindAllFlattenedAtNode methods start the clone-find-all and clone-find-all-flattened commands at a particular node.

    "felix.20240829001804.11": "Clone wars can be most annoying. The solution is simple::\n\n    **Keep clones only in the outline and in one other external file**\n\nIn particular, catchall files like leo/doc/leoProjects.txt or leo/doc/leoToDo.txt should never contain clones.\n",
    "felix.20240829001804.12": "Clones make reorganizing an outline significantly easier and faster.  Simply make top-level clones of the nodes you keep encountering during the reorg. This makes moving a node a snap: just move it from one clone to another.\n",
    "felix.20240829001804.13": ".. https://groups.google.com/d/msg/leo-editor/4s44H9cUJGY/ewRBDBSw-A8J\n\nFor the last several weeks I've used clones in a new, more effective way, inspired by git's stash/unstash commands. Here are the main ideas.\n\n1. [Most important] I avoid putting clones in two different *external* files.\n\nFor any task, I create a task node that resides in @file leoToDo.txt. I clone that node and put it in the outline, *never* in any other @file node. This instantly eliminates clone wars.\n\n2. I use top-level \"stashed\" nodes/trees in my local copy of leoPy.leo.\n\nThese clones are *not* written to any external file, so they would be lost if I lost leoPy.leo. But the risks are negligible because all stashed nodes are clones of nodes that *do* exist in external files.\n\n3. I have two main stashed trees: recent files and recent code.\n\nThe \"recent files\" tree contains clones of all the @file nodes I have worked on recently. This speeds up access to them. That happens surprisingly often--often enough to be well worth maintaining the tree. Furthermore, because Leo's new pylint command now works on trees, I can check all recently-changed files simply by running pylint on the \"recent files\" tree.\n\nThe \"recent code\" tree is even more valuable, for three reasons. The first is obvious--it speeds access to recently-changed nodes.\n\nSecond, the \"recent code\" tree allows me to work on multiple tasks without getting overwhelmed by details and loose nodes lying around. I add organizer nodes as needed to make accessing the nodes faster, and also to jog my memory about what I was doing when I changed those nodes ;-)\n\nThird, the \"recent code\" tree allows me *not* to put clones in the @file leoProjects.txt tree. This leads me to...\n\n4. I use clones in a stylized way when fixing and committing bugs.\n\nI always use clones when working on a project. A \"task\" node contains clones of all nodes related to the task. The task node typically remains in leoToDo.txt until the task is completely finished. While working on the bug, I create a clone of the task node, and move that clone to the bottom top-level node of the outline. Among other things, this makes it easy to limit searches without actually choosing \"suboutline only\" in the Find panel. This workflow is decades old.\n\nThe following is the heart of the new workflow. When a task is complete, I do the following:\n\nA. First, I create a **stashed-task** node, containing all the clones that were previously in the task node.\n\nThe *stashed-task* becomes pre-writing for the commit log. The *task* node instantly becomes pre-writing for the release notes, so if it needs to discuss any code in the clones that have just been moved to the stashed-task node, I write those words immediately, while all details are fresh in my mind.\n\nB. Now I move the cloned task node that is in leoToDo.txt to the appropriate place in leoProjects.txt.\n\nC. Next I do the commit.\n\nThe *other* clone of the task node, and the stashed task node are still within easy reach, and I typically use both nodes to create the commit log. The commit will typically consist of the changed leoToDo.txt and leoProjects.txt and whatever .py files the task itself changed. Happily, leoToDo.txt and leoProjects.txt are now up-to-date because of steps A and B.\n\nD. Finally, I clean up.\n\nI delete the top-level clone of the task node, and move the stashed-task\nnode to the \"recent code\" tree.\n\nE. Later, when it appears that activity has died down on various projects, I'll delete nodes from the \"recent files\" an \"recent code\" trees. This is a minor judgment call: I want to leave nodes in the trees while they are useful, but not significantly longer than that. I do *not* regard these trees as permanently useful. leoProjects.txt should contain *all* permanent notes about a project.\n\n===== Conclusions\n\nThis work flow may seem complicated. Believe me, it is not. It's easier to use than to describe.\n\nThis workflow has big advantages:\n\n1. Clone wars are gone for good.\n2. All recent data is easily available.\n3. Task nodes and stashed-task nodes provide natural places for proto-documentation.\n4. Banning clones from leoProjects.txt forces me to complete the first draft of the documentation before committing the fix.\n",
    "felix.20240829001804.14": "Some people seem to think that it is difficult to understand how Leo handles \"clone wars\": differing values for a cloned nodes that appear in several external files. That's not true. The rule is::\n\n    **The last clone that Leo reads wins.**\n\nThat is, for any cloned node C, Leo takes the value of C.h and C.b to be the values specified by the last copy that Leo reads.\n\nThere is only one complication::\n\n    **Leo reads the entire outline before reading any external files.**\n\nThus, if C appears in x.leo, y.py and z.py, Leo will choose the value for C in x.py or y.py, depending on which @<file> node appears later in the outline.\n\n**Note**: Whenever Leo detects multiple values for C when opening an outline, Leo creates a \"Recovered nodes\" tree. This tree contains all the various values for C, nicely formatted so that it is easy to determine where the differences are.\n\n",
    "felix.20240829001804.15": "A **dangerous** delete is a deletion of a node so that all the data in the node is deleted *everywhere* in an outline. The data is gone, to be retrieved only via undo or via backups. It may not be obvious which deletes are dangerous in an outline containing clones. Happily, there is a very simple rule of thumb::\n\n    Deleting a non-cloned node is *always* dangerous.\n    Deleting a cloned node is *never* dangerous.\n\nWe could also consider a delete to be dangerous **if it results in a node being omitted from an external file.** This can happen as follows. Suppose we have the following outline (As usual, A' indicates that A is marked with a clone mark)::\n\n    - @file spam.py\n        - A'\n            - B\n    - Projects\n        - A'\n            - B\n\nNow suppose we clone B, and move the clone so the tree looks like this::\n\n    - @file spam.py\n        - A'\n            - B'\n    - Projects\n        - A'\n            - B'\n        - B'\n\nIf (maybe much later), we eliminate B' as a child of A will get::\n\n    - @file spam.py\n        - A'\n    - Projects\n        - A'\n        - B\n\nB has not been destroyed, but B is gone from @file spam.py! So in this sense deleting a clone node can also be called dangerous.\n",
    "felix.20240829001804.16": "Q: When can I delete a clone safely?\n\nA: Any time! The only time you can \"lose\" data is when you delete a non-cloned node, save your work and exit Leo.\n\nQ: What gets \"lost\" when I delete a non-cloned node?\n\nA: The node, and all it's non-cloned children. In addition, if the node contains all clones of a cloned node, all copies of the cloned node will also be \"lost\".\n\nQ: Anything else I should be careful about concerning clones?\n\nNot really.  If you move any node out \"underneath\" an @file (@clean, etc) node, the contents of that node disappears from the external file.\n\nI hope this encourages more people to use clones.  Leo's clone-find commands are something that every Leo programmers should be using every day.",
    "felix.20240829001804.17": "Any outline (.leo file) may contain clones that appear in multiple external files defined *within* that outline. There is no problem with such **intra-outline clones**.\n\nIn contrast, **cross-outline clones** are clones that appear in more than one outline.  Leo's paste-retaining-clones command makes it possible for two outlines to contain nodes with the same gnx. Conceivably, both outlines could use those clones in the *same* external file!\n\nLeo will never encourage cross-outline clones, because such clones are inherently dangerous. Indeed, neither outline would have full responsibility for its own data. \n\nIndeed, the shared clones would be subject to the well-known multiple-update problem. Suppose the two outlines were open simultaneously, and each outline changed the shared clones in different ways. Whichever outline changed the data last would \"win.\" The changes in the other outline would be lost forever!\n\nIn short, Leo will never support features that encourage cross-outline clones.",
    "felix.20240829001804.18": "clone-find-all-flattened often includes clones of nodes whose location is unclear.  No problem! Just select the mysterious node and do Alt-N (goto-next-clone). Leo will select the next clone of that node, wrapping the search as necessary.  One or two Alt-N takes me to the \"real\" node, the node having an ancestor @<file> node.\n\nIdeally, the meaning of all nodes would be clear from their headlines.  I typically use the following conventions. For section definitions, the headline should contain file or class name.  Examples::\n\n    << imports >> (leoCommands.py)\n    << docstring >> (LeoApp)\n\n",

I am unsure about the following:\n\n*1/ How do I expose the widget within the leo environment?* \n\nIf you were only going to have one and you weren't going to destroy it, you could just do something simple like c._matplot = self in its constrictor (assuming c was passed to the constructor).\n\nIf you're going to have more than one and they may be destroyed, it might be simplest to let the free_layout / nested_splitter system manage them::\n\n    ts = c.free_layout.get_top_splitter()\n    matplotters = ts.findChildren(myMatplotWidget)\n\nshould return a list of the widgets of your class in the layout, but only if they're in the main window, widgets in extra windows opened from the \"Open window\" context menu item would be missed, I can add a find_children() method to complement the find_child() method the splitters already have to account for this.\n\nDetail: the above is just using Qt's QObject.findChildren(), the nested_splitter find_child() and (not yet written) find_children() versions search the extra windows as well.\n\nHere I have created a self.mat in your MatplotPaneProvider class to make the widget accessible but it doesn't feel like the correct way to do this::\n\n    mat = MatplotPaneProvider(c)\n    mat.mat.someMethod()\n    mat.mat.someOtherMethod()\n\n2. I would also like to make the widget accessible from any script within leo. What's the leo way of doing this?\n\nSee above\n\n3. If I create more than 1 pane containing these widgets. How do I switch between them in scripts?\n\nSee above\n\n4. Running this script more than once creates multiple items for Add Matplot when pressing the Action button. How do I stop this from happening? I have already tried returning a unique integer in * ns_provider_id *but that did not work.*\n\nThe value returned by ns_provider_id should be unique for the provider class, but constant. So it can just return something like \"matplotlib provider ver 1\"\n",
    "felix.20240829001804.22": "How it is possible to specify settings in @file? As I understand every setting should be a single outline.\n\nVitalije:\n\nYou can use clones. For example::\n\n    --@settings\n    ----my-shared-settings\n    ------...\n    ----some-specific-settings-for-this-outline\n    ------....\n\n    --@file my-shared-settings-somewhere.txt\n    ----my-shared-settings\n\nwhere `my-shared-settings` node is cloned from the @file subtree.\n\nQuite often I use some script to combine some nodes, process them and generate some output file. And such script I put in a node with the following headline: ``@button n-save @key=Ctrl-s``. Then whenever I open this outline and whenever I hit Ctrl-s to save the outline, this script is executed. Of course I put in this script `c.save()` call and on every save my files are regenerated. \n\nWhen working for a web I often use Coffeescript, some html template generators like Pug, Sass for generating css files, ... Now all of these command line tools have watching mode where they watch folders for file changes and whenever source file is changed they regenerate the output file. But then you also need to run some packaging tool to bundle all generated files. Instead of watching for file changes, my script bound to Ctrl-s regenerate source files in memory and without saving them execute suitable tool only on changed sources and produced outputs bundle in the final file. This makes the whole process much faster.\n\nAttached to this message is a Leo file that I have extracted from one of my projects. I hope that I didn't miss anything that the script require. \n\nIn the outline you can find build server implemented in Coffeescript. You have to use npm or yarn to install necessary modules for this server to work. Once installed you start server by executing\n`coffee tools/build-server.coffee` and it will start listening on port 8011. The script bound to Ctrl-s will search outline for nodes with the headlines like: @vendor, @pug, @coffee, @bulma and for each found node, it checks if the content of this node and its subtree has changed since last time and if it is, this content is sent to build server which transforms the source and returns result that script writes to output file. \n\nThere is one more thing I use for sharing outlines. There are three commands `set-reference-file`, `update-ref-file` and `read-ref-file`. The first lets you choose a reference file for this outline, i.e. public shared outline. It adds a top level headline `---begin-private-area---` to the outline. In the body of this node is the path to the public Leo file. Everything below this node is private, and above is public. The public file should be added to version control (git, fossil,...) and the private file should be added to ignored files for version control tool. And then in the script bound to Ctrl-s you can add `c.fileCommands.save_ref()`, so every time you save your private Leo file, at the same time is updated the public Leo file. That way they never get out of sync.",

From: http://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3240374\n\nUsing Leo's File-Export-Flatten Outline commands creates a MORE style outline which places all Leo body sections on the left margin. The headlines_ are indented with tabs which Excel will read as a tab delimited format. Once inside Excel there are benefits.\n\n1. The most obvious benefit inside Excel is that the body sections (Excel first column) can be selected easily and highlighted with a different font color. This makes the MORE format very readable. Save a copy of your sheet as HTML and now you have a web page with the body sections highlighted.\n\n2. It is possible to hide columns in Excel. Hiding the first column leaves just the headlines showing.\n\n3. Formulas based on searching for a string can do calculations in Excel. For example if a heading \"Current Assets\" appears on level 4 then the body formula::\n\n        =INDEX(A:A,MATCH(\"Current Assets\",D:D,0)+1)\n\nwill retrieve it. The +1 after match looks down one row below the matched headline. The trick is to place all your headlines in quotes because Excel will see + \"Current Assets\" from the MORE outline. When Excel tries without the quotes it thinks it is a range name and displays a #N/A error instead of the headline. Also you must place a child node_ below to get the + sign instead of a - sign which would give a MORE headline of -\"Current assets\" , also is an error.\n\nI think there is some interesting possibility here because of the enforcement of Leo body text being always in the first column. The Leo outline provides additional reference to organizing the problem not typical of spreadsheet models. Beyond scripting in Python, Excel is good at doing interrelated calculations and detecting problems like circular references. In Excel Tools-Options-General is a setting for r1c1 format which then shows numbers instead of letters for column references. Using this would allow entries like this in the leo body::\n\n    1000\n    3500\n    =R[-1]C+R[-2]C\n\nIn Excel you would see 4500 below those two numbers.

It happens when an @others directive or a section name appears indented in a higher-level node body.

Start Leo\n2. Click New\n3. Click Save as...\n4. Save the file as \"c:\\\\windows\\\\shellnew\\\\leofile.leo\" (or c:\\\\winnt for 2000/XP)\n5. Open regedit \"start...run...regedit\"\n6.

This is surprisingly important:\n\n- It ensures that the window will always render to pixels in the same way.\n- It makes it easier to splice in new video to an existing video.\n- It makes it easier to plan your video to ensure everything will appear as you expect.\n- It provides continuity when making a series of videos.\n\nHere is a script that I use when making Leo's screencasts::\n\n    python launchLeo.py --gui=qttabs\n    --window-size=682x1264 <list of .leo files> %*​\n\nThis *particular* --window-size causes Camtasia to create a window whose actual size is 720x1280, the nominal 720p resolution. It may prevent text blur. Or not. I do know that Leo's screencasts look great at 720p.\n",
    "felix.20240829001804.59": "Make sure that you can actually upload *excellent quality* videos before doing anything else. This step is crucial. If you skip this step, all of your initial recording an post-production work could be utterly wasted.\n\nUse *short* (10-second) test videos at this step. Their primary purpose verify that you can can get to the *end* of the production process successfully. You *are* going to make lots of mistakes here: using short videos helps you make these mistakes quickly.\n\nDon't even *think* about making longer videos until the answers to all the following questions are clearly \"yes\":\n\n- Is your camera working?\n- Is your microphone working?\n- Do you know how to record your voice and screen?\n- Can you log into YouTube or screencast.com?\n- Can you upload to YouTube or screencast.com?\n- Is the sound in your *uploaded* video great?\n- Do the pixels in your *uploaded* look great?\n\nThis last item is particularly important. Just because pixels look good in your video editor is no guarantee that they will look good when uploaded.\n\nYou are ready to try your first \"real\" take *only* when you can upload a video that looks and sounds great.\n",
    "felix.20240829001804.60": "Before rushing right out and making your first video, I recommend watching the tutorial screencasts at screencast.com: http://www.techsmith.com/tutorial-camtasia-8.html\n\nWatch the tutorials to see how the presentations themselves are organized. Watch them until it feels natural to emulate their style.\n\nIf you will be using Camtasia, you will also want to watch the tutorials to learn how Camtasia works.\n",
    "felix.20240829001804.61": "Now it's time to go beyond test videos. Even now, though, I recommend keeping your first efforts short: one minute or so. Again, this saves time. You'll ending up throwing away two or three anyway ;-)\n\nBring up your app using you demo script and run through your presentation.\n\nHere's the **most important tip**: As you narrate your video, audio flubs are inevitable, but they don't matter at all *provided* that you *realize* that you have just flubbed a word or phrase.\n\nWhen you flub a line, don't panic! Just *pause*, regroup, and repeat the phrase until you get it right. *Pausing is essential*: it simplifies inserting and deleting sound bites during post production.\n\nYou'll relax once you realize that flubs don't matter and that pausing makes post-production easier. Once you relax, getting a good take will suddenly become easier.\n\nCorrecting flubs *as soon as they happen* is absolutely essential. Don't even *think* about fixing audio flubs in post-production. It simply can't be done. Instead of spending 20 minutes trying (and failing) to correct a flub in post production, it is much faster and better to take 20 seconds during your take to correct the flub.\n\nSimilar remarks apply to video, but in my experience it's much easier to get the video right. If you do flub the video, it will be much easier if you just do a complete retake. With Camtasia, you can separate the audio and video tracks, but usually that won't work, especially if there is audio of key clicks.\n\nBy retaking audio flubs as they happen, I find it easy to work without a script. It feels more natural to me than reading a script. YMMV. When I get stuck, I just pause. Or just start over. Otoh, it wouldn't be that hard to read a script. Just *pause* before and after each phrase. Never rush your audio!\n\nIn short, the key Aha is: insert (audio) pauses *everywhere* as needed. It's easy to edit them out. It's virtually impossible to edit in the middle of words, even with the world's best audio editor.\n",
    "felix.20240829001804.62": "Post production should be easy provided that you have corrected all audio flubs as they happen. This keeps the audio and video in sync. Just edit out flubs and reduce overly-long pauses.\n\nI won't discuss production details here because they depend on the editor you are using.\n\nDo a new take if you don't have clean audio. Depending on the complexity of your video, it may be possible to splice a partial take in the middle or end of your video. Similarly, it may be possible to splice in a new take to add material you didn't cover in your first take.\n\nOne final word of advice. When editing your video, settle for \"good enough\". Perfectionism is not your friend.\n",
    "felix.20240829001804.63": "Making a screencast is a lot easier than you think :-)\n\n- Create a script that will open your app at a fixed, optimal, size.\n\n- Emulate the style and form of screencast.com tutorials.\n\n- Verify the *entire* production process with short test videos.\n\n  Before making longer videos, make *sure* that the test videos look and sound great *when they have been uploaded*.\n\n- When doing a take, flubs don't matter, *provided* you correct them *during the take*.  Use pauses.  Make haste slowly!\n\n- Splice in new takes during post-production to fix flubs and add new material.\n",
    "felix.20240829001804.64": "Here are some more tips I've learned from experience:\n\n1. Redo audio tests and video tests every time you start a new session. It's amazing how hum can creep into recordings.\n\n2. The most important step in post production is to get the pacing so it feels right. Beware of editing out pauses. Make sure you give your viewers time to see what you are doing, and to see what you have done.\n\n3. Don't waste time on callouts or captions until the audio and video work together at a relaxed pace. It's almost as hard to correct pacing mistakes as it is to correct audio flubs.\n",
    "felix.20240829001804.65": "1. Enable volume leveling and noise removal in Camtasia. This tip, all by itself, makes a big difference.\n\n2. Use a better microphone, preferably one with about a 1-inch diaphragm. This is the kind of microphone that Andrew Price uses. The Audio-technica AT2020 USB is relatively inexpensive.\n\n3. Use \"pop filter\" with the microphone. This is a cloth or (better) a metal screen that is placed in front of the microphone. It smooths the sound.\n\n4. Adjust the sound level for maximum volume without distortion: With the microphone about a foot from your mouth, turn the volume as loud as possible, then turn down until no red is visible in the meter.\n",

These documents are easier to manage, print and\nprotect using standard PDFs.\n\n**Workflow Overview**\n\n- Document content comes from a primary resource directory arranged by\n  topic (not client specific).\n- I have a Resources.leo file that helps me keep that directory organized.\n- All of the content files are written in LaTex (I use a .txi file\n  extension of my own invention to indicate the file is an 'input' file\n  only, not the main output file which uses .tex).\n- I have a Client.leo file for each client in their own directory to\n  organize work specific to each client.\n- For each document needed for a client project, I create a Document.tex\n  file from a standard template and change the document properties as\n  needed for the specific client, project and document.\n- The Document.tex file acts as the presentation 'shell' for the document\n  and I simply add \\input{\"\\ResourcePath Content.txi\"} after the\n  \\begin{document} statement (\\ResourcePath is a shortcut command to the\n  location of the content resource). This shell determines such things as\n  the document title, document type, client name, header/footer information\n  and revision date.\n- Since I work primarily in Windows, I use TeXNicCenter to process (typeset) the Document.tex file to create PDF output. (I do not use TeXNicCenter for editing, only file processing).\n\n**Workflow Notes and Shortcuts**\n\n- Years ago, I discovered the incredible exam class for LaTex and now\n  use it almost exclusively. It makes it much easier to create student\n  and teacher versions of the same content (for example, handouts for\n  students and training manual with speaking notes for the teacher).\n- I use \\@outline-data tree-abbreviations in Leo to create each new\n  Document.tex file from a template with variables (very cool!)\n- I created many @data abbreviations in Leo to speed up typing of standard\n  LaTex structures (would be happy to share them if anyone is interested).\n- All document content stays in the Resources directory and only 'shell'\n  documents are in the client directories.\n- These shell documents allow for client-specific information to be added\n  to the headers, footers and in some cases as variables inside the content\n  area itself (using \\theClient variable that I define).\n\n**Software Needed**\n\n- Leo, and its dependencies.\n- MiKTex for the LaTex distribution and package management (I have it set\n  to auto-update as needed).\n- TeXNicCenter for processing (typesetting) to PDF output.\n\n**Example Leo file**\n\n.. _`example Leo file`: https://github.com/leo-editor/snippets/tree/master/examples/workflow/latex-pdf\n\nSee this `example Leo file`_.\n\n**Questions**\n\nQ: Can you control TexNicCenter from Leo - or do you process the file and preview process manually?\n\nA: No, I run processing (typesetting) in TeXNicCenter manually. Typically,\nI create a blank project file and open however many files required for that\nproject. That way it's easier to clean up the extra files created during\nthe process steps. HTH. There might be a way to invoke the LaTex commands\nthrough Leo, but that's way above my pay grade.\n\nFrom Arjan Mossel:\n\nI'm using Leo to organize sections like \\chapter, \\section and \\subsection.\nSince I'm just writing latex in Leo, I need to keep track of the right\nhierarchies, so I can't freely move nodes around in the hierarchy or I end\nup with \\subsection at the same level as \\section, etc. It would be great\nto be able to let Leo handle this.\n\nMyProject\n  - @clean myproject/myproject.tex\n  - @clean myproject/references.bib\n  - Compile myproject.tex\n\nThe compile node has something like this::\n\n    import os\n    import subprocess\n    import sys\n\n    repository_dir = os.path.abspath(os.curdir)\n\n    # Run the system commands from the folder containing the tex, cls, clo, or bib files.\n    working_dir = os.path.join(repository_dir, 'myproject')\n    os.chdir(working_dir)\n\n    # The commands to run.\n    run_xelatex = 'xelatex ' + working_dir + os.sep + 'myproject.tex'\n    run_bibtex =  'bibtex ' + working_dir + os.sep + 'myproject'\n\n    g.es('Running XeLaTeX and BibTeX')\n    # os.system starts a new subshell\n    # @todo: is it possible to run the below commands in one subshell consecutively?\n    os.system(run_xelatex)\n    os.system(run_bibtex)\n    os.system(run_xelatex)\n\n    # Platform-independent file opening\n    def open_file(filename):\n        if sys.platform == \"win32\":\n            os.startfile(filename)\n        else:\n            opener =\"xdg-open\"\n            subprocess.call([opener, filename])\n\n    open_file('myproject.pdf')\n",

I have found that such tracebacks are generally enough to locate the general area of the problem. **Note**: These tracebacks go to the console window, so you should `run Leo in a console`_.\n\n3.
