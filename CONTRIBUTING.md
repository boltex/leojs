# How to install and run the development version

Thanks for trying out the development version of LeoInteg! :sunglasses: Contributions and pull requests are more than welcome!

## Introduction

If you're new to vscode and want to try out Leo with this vscode extension, you might want to look at this [Getting Started](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs#vscode-in-action) page to get an overview of vscode.

Furthermore, if you've never ran a vscode extension in an **Extension Development Host**, here is a [short overview about running and modifying a simple extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension).

If you're having problems, try [running this sample extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/helloworld-sample#running-the-sample) first to catch underlying problems or missing dependencies.
