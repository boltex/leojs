In Leo1, the @code directive is simply an abbreviation for a section definition line. Simplified noweb used @c as an abbreviation for @code. More importantly, simplified noweb used @c to separate doc parts from code parts without necessarily specifying a section name. It quickly became apparent that most nodes could be unnamed.

Much later I saw that a robust error recovery scheme demands that @file nodes not contain orphan and @ignored nodes. (More on this subject later.)

So external files contain blank lines between sentinel lines. These \"extra\" newlines are very useful, because the read (untangle) code can now easily determine exactly where every blank, tab and newline of the external file came from.
